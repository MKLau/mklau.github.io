I have accepted an invitation to conduct postdoctoral studies at
[Harvard Forest](http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/) (Harvard
Univeristy) to continue my research on the impacts of genetic
variation on ecological networks. I'll be working with
[Dr. Aaron Ellison](http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/aaron-ellison)
who has studied the impacts of ecological disturbance on a broad
variety of ecological systems.
