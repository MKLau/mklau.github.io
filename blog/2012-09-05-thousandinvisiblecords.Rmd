The PBS documentary, "A Thousand Invisible Cords", explores the
Genes-to-Ecosystem Research pioneered at Northern Arizona
University. The title refers to a quote from John Muir referring to
the interconnectedness of nature. The work highlighted in the film
runs parallel with Muir's sentiment, largely revealing the role that
genetically based variation plays in struturing ecosystems across
space, time and biological scales.
