I have mentored students in association with the
[Harvard Forest Research Experience for Undergraduates](http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/other-tags/reu)
(REU) Program. The REU is an ecology focused opportunity for
undergraduates to get hands-on experience conducting field and
laboratory research.
