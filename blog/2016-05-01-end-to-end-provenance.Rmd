I'll be joinging a team based at Harvard University
([Computer Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science) and
[Harvard Forest](http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/)) and [Mount
Holyoke College](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/) to work on methods for
capturing and storing information about scientific computations. We
will be focusing on
[Data Provenance](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/provenance-at-harvard),
which is a formal record of the processes that created a given data
set.
