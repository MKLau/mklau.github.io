I have been working with Dr. Stuart Borrett's
[Systems Ecology and Ecoinformatics Lab](http://people.uncw.edu/borretts/)
(aka. the SEELab) at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. to
apply and develop computational tools for analyzing complex ecological
networks. Together we have produced the [enaR](github.com/SEELab/enaR)
Ecosystem Network Analysis (ENA) package that incorporates over 40
years of research into network analysis algorithms.
