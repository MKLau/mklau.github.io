I conducted my doctoral dissertation research at Northern Arizona
University [NAU](https://nau.edu/biological-sciences/) in the
[Biological Sciences Department](https://nau.edu/biological-sciences/). I
worked primarily with Dr. Thomas G. Whitham's
[Cottonwood Ecology Group](https://nau.edu/Merriam-Powell/cottonwood-ecology/)
in association with the [Merriem-Powell Center for Environmental
Research](https://nau.edu/Merriam-Powell/).
