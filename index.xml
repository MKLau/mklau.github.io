      <description>Scientific reproducibility I am an advocate of open-source software and data sharing. You can find tools that I&amp;rsquo;ve helped to develop at provenance@harvard and on Github.
Network analysis software I have helped to code Ecosystem Network Analysis (ENA) algorithms into the R programming language. These have been integrated into an open-source software package called enaR. Check out our develop page at https://github.com/SEELab/enaR.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also programmed and hosted a Shiny app for exploring the Pitcher Plant Microecosystem model.</description>

      <description>Ecological networks I collaborate with folks in the Systems Ecology and Ecoinformatics (SEE) Lab at UNCW to develop and apply network theory based tools for studying complex ecosystems. For more info, check out Dr. Borrett&amp;rsquo;s SEELab website.
Genes to ecosystems I have collaborated with researchers at Northern Arizona University on a range of projects studying how genetic variation can impact ecosystems through a combination of experimental ecology, genetics and multivariate statistics, community genetics.</description>

      <description>Harvard Forest REU Program While at Harvard Forest I have participated as a mentor and instructor for the the Harvard Forest REU program.
R for Ecologists I have also taught introductory courses for undegrads, graduate students and professionals at the Northern Arizona University, University of Bordeaux, University of North Carolina Wilmington and Harvard Forest.
Ecosystem Network Analysis for Ecologists At the Ecological Society of America meeting, I co-taught a class on using Ecological Network Analyses (ENA) to analyze network data using the enaR software package developed for the R programming language.</description>

      <description>I’ll be joinging a team based at Harvard University (Computer Science and Harvard Forest) and Mount Holyoke College to work on methods for capturing and storing information about scientific computations. We will be focusing on Data Provenance, which is a formal record of the processes that created a given data set.</description>

      <title>A Thousand Invisible Cords</title>

      <description>The PBS documentary, “A Thousand Invisible Cords”, explores the Genes-to-Ecosystem Research pioneered at Northern Arizona University. The title refers to a quote from John Muir referring to the interconnectedness of nature. The work highlighted in the film runs parallel with Muir’s sentiment, largely revealing the role that genetically based variation plays in struturing ecosystems across space, time and biological scales.</description>

      <description>I have been working with Dr. Stuart Borrett’s Systems Ecology and Ecoinformatics Lab (aka. the SEELab) at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. to apply and develop computational tools for analyzing complex ecological networks. Together we have produced the enaR Ecosystem Network Analysis (ENA) package that incorporates over 40 years of research into network analysis algorithms.</description>

      <description>I have accepted an invitation to conduct postdoctoral studies at Harvard Forest (Harvard Univeristy) to continue my research on the impacts of genetic variation on ecological networks. I’ll be working with Dr. Aaron Ellison who has studied the impacts of ecological disturbance on a broad variety of ecological systems.</description>
